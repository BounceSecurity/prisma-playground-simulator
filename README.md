# prisma-playground-simulator

## Introduction

This is designed to be an offline version of the [Prisma Playground](https://playground.prisma.io/examples) as I found that the online version sometimes errors out and can sometimes be a little slow.

Note that this repo is based on the template that Prisma uses to demonstrate its Client Extensions, e.g. [this one](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-extensions/tree/main/row-level-security) so thanks to them for that ðŸ˜€
